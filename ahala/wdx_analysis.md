## Topic
The development of women's right significant interplays with overall economic status and health outcomes.

While substantial progress was made in the 20th century towards women's empowerment, gender inequality continues to be a global problem. In recognition of the fact women's rights have much broader societal impact, they were third in the *Mellenium Development Goals 2015 & Beyond* <sup>1</sup>. 

In 2020, there is still a large employment gender gap, unequitable health care access that disporportionately impacts women and children, and disporportionate violence specifically targeting women <sup>2</sup>. 

## Introduction
### Relevance
The COVID-19 pandemic has further confirmed the presence of these gender-based disparities. The following results are from the *2020 KFF Womenâ€™s Health Survey* <sup>3</sup>:

* While unemployment skyrocketed during the pandemic, 10% of women had to **quit** their jobs because caretaking of children and sick family members is primarily taken on by women.
* Those who did not quit had to take unpaid leave, ~50% of working mothers during the pandemic.
* 1/5th of women reported worsening mental health related to COVID-19, almost 20% more than men.

It will be come increasingly important to review pre-pandemic data related to women's workplace/home trends in order to compare it as the world begins to recover from COVID-19. It would be interesting to see whether the trends in the past decade will resume at the end of the pandemic.

### Formulating Research Questions
As a woman, it seems obvious that women should be given the same opportunities and resources as men. As a physician trained in clinical medicine and public health, I was curious to see how women's rights issues like education and employment relate to some health outcomes. 

Women's Day 2021 was recently celebrated in March 8. There were a [news article](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/gender-equal-international-womens-day-men) on the impact women's rights has on society at large that piqued my interest. The author wanted to debunk the popular beleif that women's rights are being acheived at the expense of men's rights.

It cites several interesting facts true in **gender-equal** countries<sup>4</sup> : 

* Men's health is better. They sleep better and take better care of themselves.
* Men have lower rates of depression, have lower suicide rates, and 40% less likely to die from violent causes.
* Men's level of overall life satisfaction is higher.

I am interested in finding more connections between women's statuses and other social and health outcomes.

## Preliminary Analysis
Using the World Development Explorer as well as published literature, I will be examining different relationships between women's vocational and social well-being and other development indicators.

### General Data Parameters
To focus my exploration, I looked up the best and worst countries for women's rights. My reasoning is comparing the two sides of the gender equality spectrum would allow a meaningful contrast that would aid in interpretation.
#### Country Selection
The lists were obtained from Georgetown University's 2019 data<sup>5</sup>.

The top 10 countries: 
Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Austria, UK, Luxembourg, Netherlands, and Sweden.

The bottom 10 countries: Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, South Sudan, Iraq, DR Congo, Central African Republic, Mali, and Libya.

I chose Norway and Switzerland because they were the top 2. However, I had to be careful not to choose countries from the bottom list that were confounded by a long history of political strife and war. I also added the United States because it often serves as a yardstick in discussions. The US also makes an interesting contrast to both countries because despite the fact that it is a wealthy nation, its health outcomes are not as good as similar developed countries.

**Final List of Countries:**

1. Norway
2. Switzerland
3. Mali
4. Pakistan
5. United States

#### Time Period Selection
Using Prof. Wang's guidance, the following time period was selected: **2010 to 2018**. 8 years is a sizeable amount of time to compare current and present. Moreover, an internet search of possible causal factors is more likely to be accurate with a more recent time period.

### Initial Comparison
I chose to use the *Women's Business and Law Index Score* because it is a comprehensive score composed from 8 other indicators that relate to how women interact with the law over their lifetime<sup>6</sup>. I then chose 2014 as an average mid-point within my specified time period.

**Chart Type:** Bar Chart

**Chart Interpretation**

* The chart coincides well the Georgetown data I used to choose the countries. Norway's score is a whopping 96 out of 100! Switzerland is 85. They are both almost double Mali and Pakistan which are 54 and 46, respectively.
* It might be worth noting that Mali, Pakistan, and the United States all made some gains between 2010-2018 while Norway and Switzerland did not change. 


### Question: Women's Education and Children's Health Outcomes.
It is well-understod that increased education and socioeconomic status go hand in hand. These in turn improve health. It is also has been established that parent's education and employment are significant predictor of their children's succeess. Moreover, the fourth millenial development goal (MDG) pertains to children's health and women's empowerment is the third goal<sup>7</sup>. However, childhood health has many factors. The fourth MDG demonstrates there are many preventable and often infectious causes of death to children in developing countries that have more to do with access to medicine and public health infrastructure, e.g. water and sanitation. These factors are more influenced by a country's affluence than by the mother's status. Therefore, I decided to focus on infant mortality because it is more directly connected with the mother's health, resources, and education<sup>8</sup>.

![Relationship between Women's Higher Education and Infant Mortality in 2018](https://i.imgur.com/Sdcxbb9.png "Relationship between Women's Higher Education and Infant Mortality in 2010")

**Chart Interpretation**

* I was most concerned that a country's affluence would confuse my interpretation., especially that countries with gender-equal societies like Norway and Switzerland are very wealthy. It was interesting to see that Pakistan showed tremendous growth between 2010-2018 without much changes to women's secondary eduction enrollement. We see that the infant mortality rates fell for both Pakistan and Mali during that time though Mali's growth was not as dramatic as Pakistan's. 
* There was not much change for Norway, Switzerland, and the US in the past 8 years.
* It is interesting to note that enrollment levels are similar in Switzerland and the US. They both had similar scores in the Women's Business and Law Index Score.
* The US does have a higher infant mortality rate so there must be more important factors than women's education enrollment. Health care access in the US is worse than Switzerland's which might explain this discrepancy.

#### Chart 3
I wanted to take a broader view of schooling in each of these countries since infant mortality rate did not reveal anything unexpected. The *school life expectancy* is a measure of how long women are enrolled in formal education over their lifetime and is good measure of not only literacy but also opportunities for women<sup>9</sup>.

**Indicators**
School Life Expectancy Over Time

**Chart Type:** Line Chart

![School Life Expectancy](https://i.imgur.com/4uz9YVI.png "School Life Expectancy")
**Chart Interpretation**

* The school life expectancy of wealthier nations ranged from 15 to 20. They all gradually increased over the 8 years.
* Mali shows the same gradual growth rate though it is not as steady.
* What's interesting is Pakistan's school life expectancy was lower than Mali's. It is unusual for it to cross over so dramatically. This does coincide with Pakistan's GDP growth spurt that we saw in the earlier bubble chart. I did some research to see if there are any obvious causes. It turns out the current government took office in 2013, and there has been considerable economic and health outcome improvements ever since<sup>10,11</sup>.


### Question: Men's Employment Opportunities and Women's Education

To explore the school life expectancy trend further and to examine how female educational levels might relate to men's job prospects, I made a scatter plot using the female school life expectancy and male unemployment percentage of the labor force.

#### Chart 4
**Indicators**
School Life Expectancy (female) and Unemployment (male)

**Chart Type:** Scatter plot

![Male Unemployment and Female School Life Expectancy 2018](https://i.imgur.com/c63jg1S.png "Male Unemployment and Female School Life Expectancy 2018")

**Chart Interpretation**

* Male unemployment doesn't seem to relate at all to women's schooling.
* I searched for the explanations for the major outliers. United States in 2010 was recovering from the great financial crisis. Switzerland in 2018 was going through a major slump at the end of 2018.
* Unfortunately, Pakistan and Mali's data were not available for 2010 and 2018, respectively. I tried various labor indicators, but Pakistan was missing from many of them.


## Summary
Overall, this preliminary analysis shows the interconnectedness of a country's economic robustness, the rights it provides women, and some of its health outcomes. Unfortunately, there are no major insights from this initial view of the data. In fact, I produced data that contradicted the studies cited in the journal. In Chart 5, as the *Women's Business & Law Index Score* increased male suicide rates increase (2016).

I beleive this is a good demonstration that these correlations require more rigorous analysis. There are more factors at play that I need to consider that a simplistic analysis cannot clarify. In a sense, this analysis clarifies that clarification and focus is needed!

### Thoughts about Next Steps
A recurrent theme from this preliminary analysis is that the wealth of a nation highly correlates with women's rights. I now find it surprising that the MDGs focus so much on women's empowerment when there is some evidence that focusing on a developing country's economic progress can not only impact health outcomes but also improve women's opportunities and resources.

I would like to further the connection between prosperity and improved quality of life for women.

Thanks for reading!
