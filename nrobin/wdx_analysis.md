There are many factors that influence a country’s infant mortality rate (IMR) and create large differences between neighboring countries. There are economic factors like the country of origin’s gross domestic product per capita measurement, which represents the wealth of a country normalized by the number of citizens that live in the country. In a 2013 study it was shown that “the contribution of real GDP to health spending is significant and positive. The panel Granger causality tests imply that a bi-directional causality exists between health spending and GDP” (Kumar, 2013).

Healthcare issues like the amount of money spent on health care services is another area that has an influence on infant mortality rates. The amount of money spent on health care services can be normalized by the amount of money spent per capita, which helps gain a measure of the amount spent per citizen. A 2021 study showed that “health expenditure increase reduces IMR and MMR for all economies under-study, countries at the verge of beginning their mid-income status or developing nations will benefit more in reducing death rate than countries categorised as least developed and developed economies” (Owusu PA, 2021).

Education is another measure that has an influence on infant mortality, particularly when infant mortality is measured based on the amount of education female citizens complete. Tertiary education completion has a vary strong correlation with decreased infant mortality. A 2013 study showed that infant “mortality declines significantly (by a factor of 0.40-0.96) through the direct effect of education” (Gage TB, 2013).

Let us look at gross domestic product per capita measurement. As mentioned before, it is the measure of a country’s wealth by dividing a country’s GDP by the number of citizens the country has. This helps to normalize the value so that when comparing countries with smaller populations, and likely GDP, the numbers are not skewed. The GDP calculations also utilize the PPP adjustment. “GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States” (Wang, 2021).
 
When looking at the World Bank Data for all countries the trend is pronounced and makes logical sense. The wealthier a country is, the fewer incidents of infant mortality there are in that country. As the data points move from the left to the right (indication of more wealth) they also trend from the top of the grid to the bottom (less infant mortality). The relationship is so strong that there are no low GDP countries that have similar infant mortality rate when compared to wealthy countries. Looking at the values below, there looks to be a spot where infant mortality is significantly reduced, near the $20,000 per capita mark and even more so at the $40,000 mark.

The trend continues over time for a single country, as well. The grid and images below track Colombia from 2010 – 2019. As Columbia’s GDP increased between 2010 and 2019, its infant mortality rate decreased. From 2010 to 2015 the GDP increased by almost 24 percent and the infant mortality rate decreased by over 15 percent. In 2019 the GDP increased by almost 21 percent and its infant mortality rate (IMR) decreased by almost 12 percent. Colombia’s GDP to IMR ratio is approximately 1.3k to 1 based on these numbers, which equates to each increase in GDP per capita of 1.3k decreases the rate of death by 1 per 1000 births.

The grid and images below track Argentina from 2010 – 2019. As Argentina’s GDP increased between 2010 and 2019, its infant mortality rate decreased. From 2010 to 2015 the GDP increased by over 11 percent and the infant mortality rate decreased approximately 21 percent. In 2019 the GDP increased by almost 14.5 percent and its infant mortality rate (IMR) decreased by approximately 19.6 percent. Argentina’s GDP to IMR ratio is approximately 1.06k to 1 based on these numbers, which equates to each increase in GDP per capita of 1.6k decreases the rate of death by 1 per 1000 births.

Another financial statistic that has a significant impact on infant mortality is the amount of money spent on healthcare. The relationship is similar to the GDP chart, in that the more money that is spent on healthcare, the lower the infant mortality rate. The chart below shows that there is a significant impact on infant mortality when over $2,200 per capita, PPP is spent on healthcare in a negative non-linear format.
 

The trend continues over time for a single country, as well. The grid and images below track Colombia from 2010 – 2018. As Columbia’s health expenditure increased between 2010 and 2018, its infant mortality rate decreased. From 2010 to 2014 the health expenditure increased by almost 29 percent and the infant mortality rate decreased by approximately 12 percent. In 2018 the health expenditure increased by approximately 18 percent and its infant mortality rate (IMR) decreased by over 12 percent. Colombia’s health expenditure to IMR ratio is approximately $99 to 1 based on these numbers, which equates to each increase in health expenditure per capita of $99 decreases the rate of death by 1 per 1000 births.

The grid and images below track Argentina from 2010 – 2018. As Argentina’s health expenditure increased between 2010 and 2018, its infant mortality rate decreased. From 2010 to 2014 the health expenditure increased by almost 11 percent and the infant mortality rate decreased by approximately 16.25 percent. In 2018 the health expenditure increased by approximately 2.75 percent and its infant mortality rate (IMR) decreased by 19.4 percent. Colombia’s health expenditure to IMR ratio is approximately $58 to 1 based on these numbers, which equates to each increase in health expenditure per capita of $58 decreases the rate of death by 1 per 1000 births.

The grid and images below track Argentina from 2010 – 2018. As Venezuela’s health expenditure decreased between 2010 and 2018, its infant mortality rate increased. From 2010 to 2014 the health expenditure decreased by 7.67 percent and the infant mortality rate increased by 4.75 percent. In 2018 the health expenditure decreased by over 63 percent and its infant mortality rate (IMR) increased over 36 percent. Venezuela’s health expenditure to IMR ratio is approximately $118.50 to 1 based on these numbers, which equates to each decrease in health expenditure per capita of $118.5 increases the rate of death by 1 per 1000 births.

Education is an attribute that has a major effect on infant mortality, especially when looking at the education level of the female population in a country. The less educated the female population is, the higher infant mortality percentage tends to be. The image below shows a clear relationship between the countries that have a high number of females over the age of 15 with no education and the corresponding infant mortality rate. The moderate positive linear regression is representative of all regions of the world. As the percent of the population without education increases, the infant mortality rate increases as well.
 
Narrowing the regions down to Latin America & Caribbean and Middle East and North Africa shows a similar trend. Middle East and North Africa have a more pronounced regression line which tends to show that the effect education has on infant mortality is more profound than that of the Latin America & Caribbean. However, the Latin America & Caribbean region correlation between education and infant mortality is still very strong. Haiti is the outlier at the top of the grid, which has well documented issues with access to medical facilities. Seventy-five percent of mothers, in Haiti give birth at home without a skilled birth attendant or access to emergency childbirth services (Hinteregger, 2017). Until the access to care issues are solved, education will take a backseat, in terms of impact.
 
If we look at the positive effects of education on the reduction of infant mortality, we see the opposite relationship that was shown in the lack of education above. The more years of education that female citizens have, the less incidences of infant mortality occur. The chart below details the relationship for all regions and details the reduction of infant mortality, from top to bottom, as the average number of years of education rise, from left to right. This chart demonstrates a moderate linear association
 

Narrowing the regions down to Latin America & Caribbean and Middle East and North Africa shows a similar trend. As the percentage of female population with secondary education increases the infant mortality rate decreases. As with the correlation between females without education and infant mortality rate, the Middle East and North Africa region has a stronger correlation between infant mortality rate and average total years of schooling. 
  

The final measurement that we will review is the effect of the percentage of female population over 25 that has received a college degree. Based on the chart below there is a very strong correlation between the relationship between the percentage of females with tertiary education and the infant mortality rate in all the regions. As the percentage of college educated women increases (moving from left to right) the infant mortality rate decreases (moving from top to bottom). This chart demonstrates a strong negative non-linear association.
 
Narrowing the regions down to Latin America & Caribbean and Middle East and North Africa shows a similar trend, though less pronounced. As the percentage of female population with college degrees increases, the infant mortality rate decreases. The strength of the correlation seems to swap in this chart with Latin America & Caribbean having a stronger correlation between infant mortality rate and percentage of female population of 25 with completed tertiary education than Middle East and North Africa does. 
  
Looking at the measurements above, we can conclude that there is a strong correlation between the wealth of a nation and the rate of infant mortality. As a country’s GDP increases, health spending tends to increase, which trends towards a lower infant mortality rate. In another 2013 study it was found that “If the IMR is 50/1000 and the GDP increases by 10%, we can expect the IMR to decrease to 45/1000” (O'Hare B, 2013).

The World Bank Data also shows that education of female citizens is another area that demonstrates a strong correlation with the country’s infant mortality rate. The greater number of years of education a woman has, the lower the infant mortality rate of the country. The correlation between tertiary education completion and the reduction in infant mortality rate is particularly strong. A 2017 study of South American countries showed that this relationship was based on “the positive association between maternal education and use of prenatal services and technology” (Wehby, 2017).
